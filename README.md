# USA-MEDICAL-REPORT
This report analyzes a comprehensive USA medical dataset covering 54,966 patients over six years (2019-2024).

### **INTRODUCTION**

Healthcare in the USA is a vast and complex system, providing a wide range of services to a diverse population. With numerous healthcare providers, insurance plans, and treatment options, understanding patient demographics, prevalent health conditions, and financial patterns is crucial for effective management. Medical data analysis plays a vital role in identifying trends, improving patient care, and optimizing hospital resources. This report analyzes six years of healthcare data to uncover insights into patient admission rates, common medical conditions, and doctor earnings. These findings aim to help hospital management make data-driven decisions, enhance service delivery, and improve overall patient outcomes.

### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This report presents findings from a comprehensive analysis of a USA medical dataset spanning 6 years (2019-2024) with a total of *54,966* patients. The data includes demographic information (age brackets: young, middle-aged, and old), medical conditions (arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, asthma, obesity), and information on insurance providers, test results, and medical billing. The objective was to uncover insights into healthcare trends, doctor earnings, and patient admission rates to help inform hospital management and improve service delivery.

### **DATA ANALYSIS STEPS**

 - **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned in Excel by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in date formats. Outliers were detected and reviewed for relevance, and categorical 
     data was standardized for accurate analysis.

 - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis using pivot tables, charts, and summary statistics. This included segmenting patients by year, age bracket, and medical 
     conditions. I used conditional formatting to identify trends and insights quickly.

### **KEY FINDINGS**

 - **Top 10 Highest Earning Doctors**: The highest paid doctor, Michael Smith, earned $784,502 over 6 years, managing 27 patients. This suggests a correlation between high earnings and the number of patients 
     handled, though other factors may also contribute. 

 - **Percentage of Medical Conditions**: Arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes each accounted for 17% of cases, with cancer and asthma slightly lower at 16%. Obesity also emerged as a significant condition (17%).
 
 - **Admission Rates by Age and Medical Condition**: Middle-aged patients consistently had the highest admission rates for all conditions, followed by old age and young age groups. This indicates that the middle- 
     aged demographic presents the highest demand for healthcare services.

 - **Total Number of Patients by Year**: The patient count peaked in 2021 with 11,177 patients, followed by a steady decline in 2022 and 2023, with 3,827 patients reported in 2024. This trend may indicate 
    shifting healthcare access or improvements in medical care leading to fewer hospital visits.
 
 - **Counts of Admission by Test Result**: Elective admissions were the most frequent, followed closely by urgent and emergency cases. Elective admissions totaled 6,187, while urgent and emergency cases were 
     6,100 and 6,044, respectively.
 
 - **Total Billing Amount per Year**: Billing saw a rise from approximately $150 million in 2019 to over $300 million by 2021, before declining slightly in 2024. This reflects the impact of patient volumes and 
     inflationary pressures on healthcare costs.

 - **Insurance Providers**: Cigna, Medicare, and UnitedHealthcare covered the majority of patients, with Cigna topping the list (11,139 clients). This suggests these providers are leading in market share among 
     the patients in the dataset.
