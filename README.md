### **INTRODUCTION**

Healthcare in the USA is a vast and complex system, providing a wide range of services to a diverse population. With numerous healthcare providers, insurance plans, and treatment options, understanding patient demographics, prevalent health conditions, and financial patterns is crucial for effective management. Medical data analysis plays a vital role in identifying trends, improving patient care, and optimizing hospital resources. This report analyzes six years of healthcare data to uncover insights into patient admission rates, common medical conditions, and doctor earnings. These findings aim to help hospital management make data-driven decisions, enhance service delivery, and improve overall patient outcomes.

### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This report presents findings from a comprehensive analysis of a USA medical dataset spanning 6 years (2019-2024) with a total of *54,966* patients. The data includes demographic information (age brackets: young, middle-aged, and old), medical conditions (arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, asthma, obesity), and information on insurance providers, test results, and medical billing. The objective was to uncover insights into healthcare trends, doctor earnings, and patient admission rates to help inform hospital management and improve service delivery.

### DATA ANALYSIS STEPS

 - **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned in Excel by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in date formats. Outliers were detected and reviewed for relevance, and categorical 
     data was standardized for accurate analysis.

 - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis using pivot tables, charts, and summary statistics. This included segmenting patients by year, age bracket, and medical 
     conditions. I used conditional formatting to identify trends and insights quickly.
